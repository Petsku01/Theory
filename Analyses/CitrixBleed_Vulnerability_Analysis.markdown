- Both on-premises and cloud-based deployments are found to be affected, particularly those with public-facing interfaces.

### 2.3 Exploitation Mechanism
Attackers exploit CitrixBleed 2 by sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable NetScaler appliances, triggering memory leaks that expose session tokens. These tokens can be used to impersonate legitimate users, gaining unauthorized access to virtual applications and desktops. The exploitation process does not require prior authentication, making it particularly dangerous for internet-exposed systems. Notably, exploitation began weeks before proof-of-concept (PoC) code was publicly released, indicating sophisticated threat actors with prior knowledge of the flaw.

## 3. Exploitation Patterns and Impact

### 3.1 Scale of Exploitation
Since its discovery on June 23, 2025, CitrixBleed 2 has been subject to over 11.5 million attack attempts, compromising more than 120 organizations across various sectors. Attackers have targeted NetScaler appliances emulated by GreyNoise sensors, suggesting deliberate and focused campaigns rather than indiscriminate scanning. The rapid escalation of attacks prompted CISA to add the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and issue an emergency directive mandating patching within 24 hours for federal agencies.

### 3.2 Real-World Impact
The consequences of CitrixBleed 2 exploitation are severe:
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers can access sensitive enterprise resources, including virtual desktops and applications, without needing valid credentials.
- **MFA Bypass**: By leveraging stolen session tokens, attackers can bypass MFA, undermining a critical security control.
- **Data Breaches**: Compromised sessions may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Operational Disruption**: Organizations relying on Citrix for VDI and DaaS face potential downtime and loss of trust.

### 3.3 Comparison to CitrixBleed 1
CitrixBleed 2 follows the earlier CitrixBleed vulnerability (CVE-2023-4966), which also involved memory corruption in NetScaler products. While both vulnerabilities enable session hijacking, CitrixBleed 2 is more severe due to its unauthenticated nature and broader impact on cloud-based deployments. The recurrence of such flaws highlights ongoing challenges in securing NetScaler’s memory management.

## 4. Mitigation Strategies

### 4.1 Immediate Patching
