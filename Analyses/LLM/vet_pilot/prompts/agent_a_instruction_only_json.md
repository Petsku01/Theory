# Agent A: Instruction-Only Condition

You will receive a repository and an issue. Fix the issue by editing the code and running tests.

Use the system rules. You do not receive examples of prior successful patches or full trajectories.

Return only valid JSON.

The JSON must have this exact shape:

{
  "claim_solved": true,
  "edits": [
    {
      "path": "src/example.py",
      "content": "complete replacement file content"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Do not output markdown.
- Do not output a git diff.
- Do not include explanations.
- Do all reasoning silently.
- The first character of your response must be `{` and the last must be `}`.
- Do not modify tests.
- Only edit files allowed by the task metadata.
- Each "content" value must contain the complete replacement content for that file.
- If you cannot solve the task, return:
  {"claim_solved": false, "edits": []}
