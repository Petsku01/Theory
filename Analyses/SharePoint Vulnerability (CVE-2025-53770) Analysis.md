# SharePoint Vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770) Analysis 

## Key Points
- **Exploitability**: Research suggests the SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770) was genuinely usable, with active exploitation by multiple threat actors.
- **Media Coverage**: It seems likely that the media coverage was justified, reflecting the severity and real-world impact.
- **Conclusion**: The evidence leans toward this being a significant security issue, not just hype, affecting organizations globally.

## Introduction
This report examines whether the SharePoint vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53770, was truly exploitable or if the media coverage was overhyped. Given the complexity of cybersecurity threats, we aim to provide a clear picture for organizations and individuals. The analysis is based on information gathered from reputable sources, including Microsoft announcements, security research blogs, and news articles, dated around July 2025, aligning with the current date of July 28, 2025.

## Understanding the Vulnerability
The SharePoint vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53770, is a critical flaw in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers that allowed **unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)**. This means attackers could run malicious code on affected systems without needing credentials. It was disclosed at Pwn2Own Berlin on May 17, 2025, by Dinh Ho Anh Khoa of Viettel Cyber Security and affects SharePoint Server 2016, 2019, and Subscription Edition, but **not** SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365.

## Was It Really Usable?
Research indicates the vulnerability was actively exploited starting as early as **July 7, 2025**, with threat actors deploying web shells and ransomware. Key findings include:

- **Active Exploitation**: Threat actors like **Linen Typhoon**, **Violet Typhoon** (Chinese nation-state groups), and **Storm-2603** (linked to Warlock ransomware) exploited the vulnerability.
- **Impact**: At least dozens of over 8,000 scanned SharePoint servers worldwide were compromised, particularly in North America and Western Europe, affecting sectors like government, health care, and telecommunications.
- **Microsoft Response**: Emergency patches were released on **July 19 and July 22, 2025**, with updates like KB5002768 (Subscription Edition), KB5002754 (2019), and KB5002760 (2016).

The vulnerability’s high CVSS score of **9.8** and the rapid release of proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub by July 21, 2025, further confirm its usability.

## Media Coverage: Hype or Reality?
The media coverage was extensive but appears justified given the severity and active exploitation. Key points include:

- **Timeline**: 
  - Microsoft confirmed active attacks on **July 19, 2025** via the [Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/).
  - AP News and CNBC reported on **July 22, 2025**, highlighting widespread attacks.
  - CISA issued warnings on **July 20 and 24, 2025**, noting potential widespread impact [](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/07/20/update-microsoft-releases-guidance-exploitation-sharepoint-vulnerabilities).
  - Security researchers (e.g., Unit 42) provided updates through July 25, 2025.

- **Sources and Depth**: Coverage from reputable sources included technical details, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and mitigation strategies, indicating a balanced approach.
- **Public Reaction**: PoC releases and demonstrations by Code White GmbH on **July 14, 2025**, amplified attention, but this reflected the real threat, not hype.
- **Expert Consensus**: Experts like Adam Meyers from CrowdStrike called it a "significant vulnerability," aligning with CISA and Microsoft’s urgency.

There is no evidence suggesting the media coverage was overhyped; it seems to have been a necessary response to a critical issue.
