# Research Journal: Adblock Usage, Benefits, Mobile Installation, and Online Tracking

## Introduction

I’ve been using adblockers for years, and honestly, I can’t imagine browsing the internet without them. The constant pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and creepy targeted banners used to drive me nuts—not to mention the uneasy feeling that my every click was being tracked. That’s why I decided to dive deep into adblockers: why they’re worth using, how to set them up on phones, and just how much spying is happening online. Ads are a big part of how the internet stays free, funding tons of websites and services, but they come with real downsides like privacy invasion, slower browsing, and a cluttered experience. Adblockers—those handy tools that stop ads and trackers in their tracks—are a game-changer. In this journal, I’ll share what I’ve learned about picking the right adblocker, its benefits, how to get it working on your phone, and the extent to which search engines, websites, and advertisers are keeping tabs on us.

## Why Use an Adblocker?

Adblockers have become my go-to for a better online experience, and here’s why they’re so essential.

### Privacy Protection
It’s kind of shocking to realize that 90% of websites have trackers, often from big players like Google, collecting data on what I’m doing online. Whether I’m reading news or checking out a health-related site, my data could be shared with third parties like TikTok—yikes! Adblockers like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger stop these trackers, giving me more control over my privacy. A study found that 52% of Americans use adblockers, with 20% citing privacy as their main reason ([Ghostery Privacy Pulse Report](https://www.ghostery.com/privacy-pulse-report)). Even cybersecurity experts (76%) and advertisers (66%) use them to avoid invasive tracking. Plus, adblockers protect against “malvertising”—ads that can sneak malware onto your device just by loading a page.

### Performance Benefits
I’ve noticed a huge difference in how fast websites load since I started using an adblocker. Pages that used to crawl now pop up almost instantly. A 2015 study showed that Mozilla Firefox’s Tracking Protection cut data usage by 39% and page load times by 44% on 200 popular news sites ([Ad-blocking: A Study on Performance, Privacy and Counter-measures](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3091478.3091514)). For someone like me with a limited data plan, that’s real savings—think $9.50 a month just from ads on a site like Boston.com! Adblockers also reduce CPU and GPU usage, which means my phone’s battery lasts longer, especially when I’m browsing on the go.

### Enhanced User Experience
Ads, especially pop-ups and auto-playing videos, can make browsing feel like wading through a digital swamp. Adblockers clear out the clutter, letting me focus on what I actually want to see. A field experiment found that adblocker users spend 28% more time browsing and view 15% more pages than non-users ([The Effect of Ad Blocking on User Engagement with the Web](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3178876.3186162)). Some adblockers, like AdBlock Plus, even let “acceptable ads” through—non-intrusive ones that don’t ruin the experience—but I prefer blocking everything for a cleaner vibe.

### Economic and Ethical Considerations
I’ll admit, I feel a bit guilty knowing that adblockers can hurt website revenue—publishers lost an estimated $54 billion in 2024 because of them. But there’s a silver lining: adblockers filter out users like me who rarely click ads, making ads 190% more effective for non-users. Plus, I’m happy to pay for ad-free subscriptions to support creators I love. The distrust in companies like Google (44% of Americans don’t trust them) and Meta (56%) pushes me to use adblockers to take back some control over my data.

## Choosing the Right Adblocker

Picking an adblocker can feel overwhelming with so many options out there. I’ve tried a few, and here’s what I’ve learned about what makes a good one.

- **Effectiveness**: uBlock Origin is my favorite because it blocks ads and trackers without letting anything slip through. AdBlock Plus is popular but allows “acceptable ads,” which I’m not a fan of since I want total control over what I see.
- **Performance Impact**: uBlock Origin is lightweight and doesn’t slow down my browser, unlike some commercial adblockers that can add their own trackers—ironic, right?
- **Customizability**: For tech-savvy folks, uBlock Origin lets you tweak rules to block specific ad networks like Google AdSense. It’s like having a custom shield for your browser.
- **Open-Source vs. Commercial**: I stick with open-source options like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger because they’re transparent and community-driven. Commercial adblockers sometimes prioritize profit over privacy, which defeats the purpose.

### Recommended Adblockers
Here’s my shortlist based on what I’ve tried and researched:
- **uBlock Origin**: Top-notch for blocking everything, super lightweight, and open-source. Perfect for privacy nerds like me.
- **Privacy Badger**: Automatically blocks trackers that violate privacy—great for beginners who don’t want to mess with settings.
- **AdBlock Plus**: Popular but lets some ads through, so it’s not my first choice.
- **Ghostery**: Focuses on tracker blocking, solid for privacy-conscious users.
- **Brave Browser**: Comes with a built-in adblocker that’s fast and blocks ads and trackers by default.

## Installing Adblockers on Mobile Devices

Getting adblockers working on my phone was a game-changer, especially since I’m always on my Android with a limited data plan. Mobile adblocking can be trickier than on desktops, but here’s how to do it.

### Android
- **Browser Extensions**: I use Brave Browser on my Android because its built-in adblocker, called “Shields,” blocks ads and trackers without needing extra setup. You can also use Firefox: go to Menu > Add-ons, search for “uBlock Origin” or “AdBlock Plus,” and enable it. Configure settings for stricter blocking if you want.
- **Dedicated Apps**: Apps like AdGuard and Blokada are great for system-wide adblocking. Download them from the Google Play Store or trusted APK sources, then follow the in-app instructions. Some require a VPN-like setup, which can be a bit of a hassle but worth it.
- **Built-in Browser Solutions**: Brave is my go-to because it’s plug-and-play. Just download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser) and enable Shields in settings. It even plays YouTube videos without ads!
- **Network-Level Blocking**: For advanced users, devices like Pi-hole (needs a Raspberry Pi) or apps like AdTrap block ads at the DNS level for all devices on your network.

### iOS
- **Browser Extensions**: Safari supports adblockers like AdBlock Plus or AdGuard. Download from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/), then go to Settings > Safari > Extensions to enable and configure them.
- **Content Blocker Apps**: Apps like 1Blocker provide system-wide adblocking through Safari. Enable them in Settings > Safari > Content Blockers.
- **VPN-Based Adblockers**: AdGuard Pro uses a local VPN to filter ads across apps and browsers. Set it up in Settings > General > VPN.
- **Brave Browser**: Download Brave from the App Store and enable Shields for automatic ad and tracker blocking.

### Challenges on Mobile
Mobile adblocking isn’t perfect. iOS browsers like Safari don’t support as many extensions as desktops, so you might need dedicated apps or VPN-based solutions. Some adblockers, like AdGuard, can drain battery due to VPN usage, but they save data overall. Also, some websites detect adblockers and block content, though uBlock Origin often sneaks past these.

## Extent of Tracking by Search Engines, Websites, and Advertisers

It’s honestly a bit scary how much tracking happens online. Every click, search, or page visit feels like it’s being watched, and adblockers are one way to fight back.

### Search Engines
Google is the king of tracking, with its trackers (like DoubleClick) on 90% of websites, collecting data on searches, browsing history, and even your location. Even privacy-focused engines like DuckDuckGo can sometimes leak data through third-party integrations, though they’re way better than Google. With 44% of Americans distrusting Google’s data practices, it’s no wonder people are turning to adblockers.

### Websites
Trackers are everywhere—90% of websites have them, and 60% of privacy-sensitive sites (like health-related ones) are no exception. Google, Facebook, and Twitter trackers follow you across the web, logging your visits and interactions. Some sites (6.7% of the top 5,000) even use anti-adblock scripts to detect and counter adblockers, which feels like a sneaky move by the ad industry.

### Advertisers
Advertisers use real-time bidding (RTB) to target ads based on your profile, sharing your data across ad networks and analytics servers. They build detailed profiles using your demographics, browsing habits, and purchases. Adblockers disrupt this by blocking cookies and tracking pixels, but the privacy risks are real—re-identification can link “anonymous” data back to you, and malvertising can sneak malware into your device.

### Scale of Tracking
Globally, 31.5% of internet users (912 million in 2023) use adblockers, with 496 million on mobile. Usage is higher in privacy-conscious regions like Europe, thanks to laws like GDPR. But the industry is fighting back—YouTube and Spotify restrict access for adblocker users, and Google’s Manifest V3 changes might weaken adblockers on Chrome.

## Conclusion

Adblockers are more than just a way to skip annoying ads; they’re essential for protecting privacy, speeding up browsing, and making the internet enjoyable again. uBlock Origin and Brave Browser are my personal favorites for their effectiveness and ease of use. Setting them up on phones is straightforward, though mobile environments have some quirks. The amount of tracking online—by search engines, websites, and advertisers—is honestly overwhelming, but adblockers give us a fighting chance to take back control. That said, I get that publishers need to make money, so I try to support my favorite sites with subscriptions when I can. Looking ahead, we need to find a balance between user privacy and sustainable revenue models for the internet. Until then, I’m keeping my adblocker on, and I’d encourage you to give one a try—your phone and your sanity might thank you.

## Recommendations
- **Users**: Try uBlock Origin or Brave Browser for robust ad and tracker blocking. Update filter lists regularly and whitelist sites you want to support.
- **Publishers**: Use non-invasive ads or subscriptions to reduce reliance on tracking. Aggressive anti-adblock tactics just push users away.
- **Advertisers**: Focus on privacy-respecting ads, like contextual ones, to build trust.
- **Policymakers**: Consider laws to protect adblocker usage, as 33% of Americans support this to prioritize privacy.
