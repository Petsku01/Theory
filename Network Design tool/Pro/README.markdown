# Network Designer Pro

## Overview
Network Designer Pro is an interactive web-based application for designing and visualizing network topologies. It allows users to create, connect, and manage network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, servers, computers, and access points. The tool provides features for device placement, connection creation, validation, and configuration export, with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Features
- **Device Management**: Add, duplicate, or delete devices (Router, Switch, Firewall, Server, Computer, Access Point).
- **Connection Creation**: Connect devices to simulate network links.
- **Network Validation**: Validate the network design to ensure correctness.
- **Undo/Redo**: Support for undoing and redoing actions (⌘Z/⌘Y).
- **Auto Layout**: Automatically arrange devices for optimal visualization.
- **Save/Load**: Save network designs and load them later.
- **Export Config**: Export network configurations for external use.
- **Zoom & Pan**: Zoom in/out and center the view for better navigation.
- **Properties Panel**: View and edit properties of selected devices.
- **Validation Feedback**: Displays validation results for the network.

## File Structure
- **network-designer-improved(1).html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and UI components of the application.

## Usage
1. **Open the Application**: Load `network-designer-improved(1).html` in a web browser.
2. **Add Devices**: Drag devices from the toolbox (Router, Switch, Firewall, etc.) onto the canvas.
3. **Connect Devices**: Use the "Connect" tool to create links between devices.
4. **Configure Devices**: Select a device to view and edit its properties in the properties panel.
5. **Validate Network**: Click the "Validate" button to check the network for errors.
6. **Save/Load Designs**: Use the "Save" and "Load" buttons to persist and retrieve network designs.
7. **Export Configuration**: Click "Export Config" to generate a configuration file.
8. **Undo/Redo**: Use ⌘Z to undo and ⌘Y to redo actions.
9. **Auto Layout & Center View**: Use these options to organize the canvas or reset the view.

## Interface Components
- **Header**: Displays the application title and network statistics (Devices, Links, VLANs).
- **Toolbar**: Contains buttons for actions like Select, Connect, Delete, Undo, Redo, Auto Layout, Validate, Save, Load, Export Config, and Center View.
- **Toolbox**: Lists available devices with icons and categories (e.g., Router - L3 Device, Switch - L2 Device).
- **Canvas**: The main area for dragging and arranging devices and connections.
- **Properties Panel**: Shows details and editable properties of the selected device.
- **Validation Panel**: Displays validation results after clicking the "Validate" button.
- **Status Bar**: Shows the application status, cursor coordinates, zoom level, and selection details.
- **Context Menu**: Provides options to duplicate or delete selected devices and view properties.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- No additional server-side dependencies are required, as the application runs entirely in the browser.

## Notes
- The application is designed to be intuitive for network engineers and IT professionals.
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser for full functionality.
- The HTML file assumes integration with a JavaScript framework or library for dynamic behavior (not included in the provided HTML).

## Future Improvements
- Add support for VLAN configuration and management.
- Enhance the export functionality to support multiple configuration formats.
- Implement advanced validation rules for complex network scenarios.
