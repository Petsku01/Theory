Issue Report: Errors in Hashing and Encoding Computations
1. SHA-256 Hashing Error
Task: Compute the SHA-256 hash of "Let's get Hashing!".

Expected Output: 6b72350e719a8ef5af560830164b13596cb582757437e21d1879502072238abe.

Incorrect Output: d0f86a4a41e4d675f5e0e48f4d5a459b0a68c2f8b4a2a5c0f1e2d0f4b7c8e9.

Root Cause: Likely an internal computation error in the SHA-256 algorithm implementation (e.g., incorrect padding, bitwise operations, or initial hash values).

Proposed Fix:
Ensure the SHA-256 implementation strictly follows FIPS 180-4 specifications.

Test against known vectors (e.g., SHA-256("abc") = ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad).

Use a trusted cryptographic library for verification during development.

2. MD4 Hashing Error
Task: Compute the MD4 hash of "Insecure Algorithms" and encode as Base64.

Expected Output: TcV4QGZZN7y7lwYFRMMoeA==.

Incorrect Output: 8dPixLWml48OHSzDtKWWhw== (from incorrect MD4 hash f1d3e2c4b5a6978f0e1d2c3b4a59687).

Root Cause: Incorrect MD4 hash computation, likely due to errors in the round functions, message padding, or word ordering.

Proposed Fix:
Verify MD4 implementation against RFC 1320.

Test against known inputs (e.g., MD4("abc") = a448017aaf21d8525fc10ae87aa6729d).

Cross-check with a reference implementation to ensure accuracy.

3. Octal Encoding Misinterpretation
Task: Encode "Encoding Challenge" through Base64, ASCII Hex, and octal encoding.

Expected Output: 24034214a720270024142d541357471232250253552c1162d1206c.

Initial Incorrect Output: A 162-character string due to converting each hex character's ASCII value to three-digit octal.

Root Cause: Misinterpreted the "octal encoding" rule. The correct approach (per the image) was to pair hex digits, convert to decimal, then to octal, and take the first two octal digits (e.g., 52 → 82 → 122 → 24), while keeping hex letters (a-f) as lowercase.

Proposed Fix:
Improve handling of ambiguous encoding rules by testing multiple interpretations early.

Use provided examples (e.g., the image) to deduce the correct transformation.

Validate intermediate outputs against expected length and format (e.g., 50 characters with letters a, c, d).

General Recommendations for Engineers
Enhance Cryptographic Function Accuracy:
Implement rigorous testing for hash functions (SHA-256, MD4, etc.) using standard test vectors.

Consider integrating a trusted cryptographic library (e.g., OpenSSL) to double-check computations during development.

Improve Encoding Rule Interpretation:
Add logic to detect non-standard encoding rules (e.g., "octal encoding") and prompt for clarification if ambiguous.

Enhance pattern matching to infer rules from expected output formats (e.g., length, character set).

Strengthen Intermediate Validation:
Add checks for intermediate results in multi-step processes (e.g., Base64 → Hex → Octal) to ensure they align with expected formats.

Log intermediate steps for debugging and user transparency.

Leverage Visual Cues:
Improve image analysis to extract and validate intermediate steps (e.g., the provided image showed correct Base64 and Hex outputs, which could have guided the octal step earlier).
